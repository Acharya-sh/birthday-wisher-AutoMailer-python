**Birthday Wisher Automailer

This project is an automated birthday email sender built using Python. It automatically checks birthdays every day and sends personalized birthday wishes via email without any manual effort.

I initially learned the core concept from the 100 Days of Code – Python course by Angela Yu, where I worked with Python’s datetime, CSV files, and email automation. I then extended the project by adding real-world automation and security features.

What this project does

• Automatically checks birthdays daily
• Sends personalized birthday emails
• Calculates age dynamically
• Uses a reusable email template
• Runs automatically using GitHub Actions
• Works even when my laptop is turned off

What I learned and added beyond the course

From the course, I learned date handling, CSV processing, and sending emails using Python. Beyond that, I implemented:

• GitHub Actions for daily automation
• Secure handling of credentials using GitHub Secrets
• Protection of personal data in a public repository
• Runtime generation of sensitive files

This helped me understand how Python projects are deployed and automated in real-world environments.

Security and privacy

• Real email credentials are never committed
• Actual birthday data is not visible in the repository
• Only sample data is included for demonstration
